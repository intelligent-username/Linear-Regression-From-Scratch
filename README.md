# Linear Regression From Scratch

Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (like house prices) and one or more independent variables (like size or location). It assumes a linear relationship, fitting a straight line to the data points that best predicts the outcome. It's simple, interpretable, and widely used in fields like economics, biology, and machine learning for prediction and inference.

## Why Implement from Scratch?

Building linear regression from scratch helps deepen your understanding of the math behind itâ€”think gradient descent, least squares, and optimization algorithms. Implementing it can help us understand what is going on under the hood and tweak/re-implement the algorithm when there are errors. Plus, it's satisfying to see how the pieces fit together, and it gives you full control over the implementation for custom tweaks or educational purposes.
